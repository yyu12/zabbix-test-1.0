Zabbix plug-in for iLO Agentless Management
------------------------------------------
Zabbix plug-in for iLO Agentless Management aims to automatically manage 
HPE ProLiant servers within the data center. With the help of the plug-in,
the administator does not need to add the ilo host manually.
The plug-in automatically add the HPE ProLiant servers which is
discovered within the data center.

Requirements:
-------------
- Net-snmp
- snmptrapd
- HPE ProLiant Server 
- python >= 2.3 and python-argparse or python >= 2.7

Features:
-------------
1) Discover and monitor HPE ProLiant servers within data center automatically. There are two alternatives to discover HPE ProLiant servers.

	1.1) Active discovery: The active discovery scans all available servers 
			       in the network of the monitoring server. This 
			       approach can discovery all up and running servers
			       with the data center. This feature is supported
			       started version 1.1.0. Note that this feature
			       is a time-consuming process if your data center
			       has lots of hosts/IP addresses to be discovered.

	1.2) Passive discovery: The passive discovery discovers HPE ProLiant 
				servers once receiving the cold start traps 
				generated by those servers. The traps are 
				generated when those servers get booted 
				successfully, so this approach cannot discover 
				the up and running servers within the data 
				center.  

2) Provide the high-level server status. 

3) Display the server status in real-time if the status is changed. 

4) Categorize the preferred servers into the same host group.
